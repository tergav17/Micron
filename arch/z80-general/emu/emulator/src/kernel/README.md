# Z80 SKERN
The Z80 SKERN (Simple Kernel) is the kernel that the z80-general programs run on top of. It is written in Z80 assembly, and it provides all of the basic functions needed to run MICRON. These include context switching, process handling, memory managment, pipe managment, and program loading. In addition, when the kernel first loads, it will start a process that loads the CONSOLE into memory, and acts as the SY device.
