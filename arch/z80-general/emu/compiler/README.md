# Z80-General Cross Compiler
  This program can be used to produce .PRG binary files for MICRON under the architecture of z80-general.
  
  Usage:
```
java -cp MBAS.jar main.Main
```
The program will then prompt you for a input and output file. 

Note, if there is an error, in order to get the correct line number, there must be no comments or white space in the source.

Maybe someday I will clean this program up some.
