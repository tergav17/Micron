# Templates
  In this directory are a number of templates that can be used for writing applications. In addition to these templates, applications found in the "core" directory can be used and modified for more complex projects.
  
# DRVTS.PRG
  DRVTS.PRG (Driver Test) is a barebone device driver. When compiled and ran on it's own. it will accept a two letter argument (Ex: ```DRVTS DX```) for the name of the driver, and then attatch itself to the system. It will respond validly to all driver commands, but other than that it serves more as a test or a template.
  
# TEM.PRP
  TEM.PRG (Template) is a barebone program that instantly terminates itself after running. It is short and can provide a simple template for new projects.
